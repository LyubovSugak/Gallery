# Belka-art

Belka-art is my final project. It is became a great opportunity to present art-works of mine and my friends. The most challenging part for me was to make correctly the structure of the application based on my knowledge of `React`. It helped me to understand better what is hidden behind the words MVC philosophy. My personal goal in this project was to work more with `React`, `PostgreSQL` and `CSS` to make it look like real on-line gallery. 

1. On the main page we can choose one of the three category (Painting, Photography or Handcraft), then we see a big logo, on the bottom are presented new works (I used owl-carousel with infinity effect), on the footer – links to social-networks and portfolio of my partners – web designers.
