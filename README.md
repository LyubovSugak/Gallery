# Belka-art

Belka-art is my final project. It is became a great opportunity to present art-works of mine and my friends. The most challenging part for me was to make correctly the structure of the application based on my knowledge of `React`. It helped me to understand better what is hidden behind the words MVC philosophy. My personal goal in this project was to work more with `React`, `PostgreSQL` and `CSS` to make it look like real on-line gallery. 

1. On the main page we can choose one of the three categories (Painting, Photography or Handcraft), then we see a big logo, on the bottom are presented new works (I used owl-carousel with infinity effect), on the footer – links to social-networks and portfolio of my partners – web designers.

2. Each category has subcategories, for example, Painting – possible to choose works according to Painting Category or Technique.

3. I chose at Painting Categories – Landscape (in database I have two authors)

and here – Technique watercolor, if there are a lot of works owl-carousel is ready to show all of them.

Click on the photo of author links to the page with all works exactly this author. 

4. It’s great to try customizing a frame clicking on the image of a single work –  choose a width and a color of frame. Here we can see the technique and dimensions of the work. The most fancy staff is possibility to imagine the art-piece at the interior. In this case I used owl-carousel as well but put on another <div> with image and managed it’s position at the CSS file.
